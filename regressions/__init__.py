"""
Regressions
===========

Provides various forms of regression which are not all covered by other
Python statistical packages. The aim is to achieve clarity of
implementation with speed a secondary goal. Python 3.5 and Numpy 1.10 or
greater are required as the new '@' matrix multiplication operator is
used.

All of the regressions require the X and Y data to be provided in the form
of matrices, with one row per data sample and the same number of data
samples in each. Currently missing data or NaN are not supported.
